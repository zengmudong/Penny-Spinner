# Activity: Penny vs Nickel Game


## Files 
- [PennyVsNickelGame.pdf (Link)](PennyVsNickelGame.pdf) is a PDF of the game we will play and then simulate
- [PennyVsNickelGame.Rmd (Link)](PennyVsNickelGame.Rmd) is an RNotebook starter document with the activity template


## Instructions 
- Play the game with one or more partners and record the outcomes in Part 1.  
- Students are encouraged to help one another complete the remainder of the activity, but each person will submit their own RNotebook to Canvas  
- **Do not load any R packages for this activity** since the goal is to practice Base R syntax
- You should make commits in GitHub as you complete the activity  
- Submit the completed R Notebook as HTML to Canvas before deadline  


## Grading

#### Assignment is worth a total of 10 points.

- [1 points] No R packages loaded at all (because we're practicing with Base R)
- [2 points] Play the game and complete part 1
- Part 2
    - [2 point] Expectations
    - Simulation Step 1 (nothing to submit)
    - Simulation Step 2 (nothing to submit)
    - [2 points] Simulation Step 3--simulate Spinner B
    - [2 points] Simulation Step 4--simulate Spinner A
    - [1 points] Simulation Step 5--correct answer 

#### Tips for completing the activity

- Note: you only need to observe an outcome (e.g., penny or nickel) 5 times to "win" a round of the game; an older version of the game required you to observe a coin 8 times before it was said to "win" the round.
- The point is to simulate the game exactly as you would play it (using loops & indexing).  
- Start with relatively few simulated rounds (~100) until you are comfortable that the simulation works properly.  Then, increase the number of simulated rounds to produce a *stable* estimate to at least two digits of precision.  
- "stable estimate" here means that if you repeat your simulation a few times and round the answer to the second decimal place (i.e., hundredths), the rounded result should not vary due to the inherent randomness from one simulation to the next.
